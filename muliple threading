//multi threading- one process having multiple threads is called multiple threading ,space matters.threa is the part of processor
//thread is the sub process of the main process// multi thrading - to increase the utlilty of the system
// example -puppet show
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	    Thread obj=Thread.currentThread();// it returns the current class thread
		System.out.println(obj.getName());
		//if we want to change the name of the thread 
		obj.setName("anshikaa");
		System.out.println(obj.getId());
		System.out.println(obj.isAlive());//if it is alive it is in running state else it is executed
		System.out.println(obj.getPriority());//to know the priority of the particular thread
		System.out.println(obj.isDaemon());//to check in thread you are working is daemon thread or not
		//
	}
}
//how to create multi threading application
//there are two ways
// by extending the thread class 
// by implementing the runable interface-it is known as functional interface-one method -rum() method //lambda expression
